    <p>Like any startup things happen fast.</p>

<p>This past week the Operation Code volunteer board of directors held a call to elect a new board chair. Nick Frost who had been serving as chair since late September stepped aside and while he’ll continue to serve as a board director and volunteer on the PR/Marketing Committee we needed to elect a new chair, begin assigning board committees, and an annual board meeting.</p>

<p>Over the summer on Thursday, August 6th I began an interesting conversation. This time though it wasn’t like the other 99% emails. It had nothing to do with a veteran looking for scholarships to start or finish code school, a code school requesting to be added to our coding boot camp list, or a pull request. While each of these is important, this correspondence was very different. Instead it went something like this:</p>

<p>*Hi Dave,
I’m in the system. Thank you.</p>

<p>Wanted to see if there was any process in place for helping code camps/schools do the GI Bill paperwork… I’m former JAG and thought I could reach out to a couple schools in Miami to see if they are interested in me helping them getting approved to accept the GI Bill. Wanted to get a feel for what that might involve.</p>

<p>v/r,
Mark Kerr*</p>

<p>Over a series of emails, I got to know Mark. My response:</p>

<p>*Hi Mark,
Your efforts here would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>All code schools/bootcamps need to be 1st licensed through their state SAA (http://www.nasaa-vetseducation.com/Contacts.aspx). Once that’s done they have to wait 2-years. But like Skill Distillery, if we can help navigate these schools through the VA process, we can perhaps shorten this time wait.</p>

<p>Could you help with this? Maybe take the South east region, or just Florida?</p>

<p>V/r,
Dave*</p>

<p>Mark’s response:</p>

<p>*Dave,</p>

<p>Sure, let me call Florida tomorrow. If it looks doable then I can reach out to the bootcamps in Miami to see if there is interest.  Is it OK if I reference that I’m volunteering for Operation Code?</p>

<p>If the process isn’t too involved (I have 2 small children, so time is a premium), then I’ll get to work on the S.E. as a whole. Also, if you are interested, I may be able to get some legal bro bono work from some of the bigger firms in Miami, which may speed up the process greatly as we can throw some more bodies at it.</p>

<p>V/r,
Mark*</p>

<p>My response:</p>

<p>*Hi Mark,
Absolutely. Put me down as reference.</p>

<p>More pro bono the better. The more hands on deck on this the better.</p>

<p>We can almost call this the JAG Brigade?</p>

<p>V/r,
Dave*</p>

<p>Mark’s response:</p>

<p>*I like it!</p>

<p>Tried Florida but got a machine so will keep at tomorrow if I don’t hear back.</p>

<p>V/r,
Mark*</p>

<p>(side note: states are understaffed at the SAA level. Sometimes one per state. Yes, one person.) My response:</p>

<p>*Mark,
What do you need from us as a nonprofit to credit pro bono work?</p>

<p>V/r,
Dave*</p>

<p>Mark’s response:</p>

<p>*In Florida it is on the honor system so wouldn’t be a need to verify but firms may want to document the relationship to ensure there is no conflict of interest. As a gov attorney, I’m exempt from needing to do pro bono but will have certain limits on what representation I could provide (which I don’t think will be an issue for this type of work, especially as it doesn’t technically require a law license to help with the paperwork).</p>

<p>V/r,
Mark*</p>

<p>My response:</p>

<p>*Any luck in Florida?</p>

<p>V/r,
Dave*</p>

<p>Mark’s response:</p>

<p>*Kind of… The POC for Miami emailed me that she is out of town and will call me tomorrow when she is back in the office.</p>

<p>[next day]</p>

<p>Call went well. The Miami POC for the state is Madeline Mendez (info below).</p>

<p>Once I was able to make clear that I’m a veteran, volunteering for veterans’ organization, and that neither I nor Operation Code are running programs, the call went pretty well.  She was able to look up Skill Distillery in the VA database so agrees that we should be able to do this here. Next step will be for me to see if there is any interest from the local camps. She also agreed to participate in a call or meeting in case there are any questions or concerns the schools have. A bit of paperwork to fill out but the hard requirements seem to be being registered already with the State board and in operation at least 2 years.</p>

<p>I think the best way to go forward is for me to start reaching out to the camps, see if there is interest, and then before we start on the paperwork – have a discussion with Madeline to make sure that the interested schools are likely to qualify. If they are, then I can help with the paperwork (although most of it looks pretty straightforward and is stuff that someone internal will have to complete). Madeline will then review the paperwork, do a site visit and submit to the State for approval.  Let me know if you think that will work, and I’ll get started.</p>

<p>V/r,
Mark*</p>

<p>Over the next 70-days, we begin discussing the evolving formation of the JAG Team, on-boarding volunteer attorneys to support code school licensing, and the creation of a “Licensing Toolkit for Code Schools” and by September 17th invited Mark to consider joining our board ranks:</p>

<p>*Mark,
Your help with the toolkit, Florida and recruiting military veterans is beyond helpful. It has provided us much needed momentum and shift our approach to more service-organization and help these code schools better serve the military and veterans community, and engage a sector of the military community we hadn’t considered–former JAGs.</p>

<p>Like you, I have a family and three young daughter (under 7), and busy trying to survive while building this plane and flying it. Drum roll… We have a spot open on our new board of directors (https://operationcode.org/board), and would like to extend an invitation to join us. Goal is to have 12 directors (including 4 officers) to even out work load–because we’re an open source nonprofit, we get a ton of help from the software and developer community. The position open now: Secretary.</p>

<p>At this point, I’m recruiting 5 more board members to include, an attorney, CPA, former nonprofit exec, influencer/Pentagon, VC or strategist.</p>

<p>Currently, our board is comprised mostly of military veterans who either are software developers or work for software companies, companies such as Twilio, Mattermark, Message Systems, SendGrid and Shiftboard.</p>

<p>The only difference between now in your volunteer work, and acceptance: you’d be on the governing board.</p>

<p>Let me know and will do an intro.</p>

<p>V/r,
Dave*</p>

<p>This past Thursday, we had a board call.
