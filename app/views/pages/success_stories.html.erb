          <p>"It's been refreshing to see that other veterans share the same path as me - transitioning from military service to professional software development. By taking part in Operation Code's community, I've had the chance to pair-program with others, be introduced to new tech stacks that I was previously unfamiliar with, prepare for a software bootcamp, and find an internship through an opening posted in the <b><a href="https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/jobs/">#jobs</a></b> channel. <b>Operation Code fosters a community where members support each other, offer & accept advice, and serve as an ongoing reminder that we're all still part of one team."</b></p>

          <p>"Prior to Operation Code, I was working day-in and day-out pouring concrete and general heavy labor construction when I learned about Operation Code. Due to their <b><a href="/mentorship">mentorship</a></b> I skipped on finishing community college, borrowed a MacBook Pro from Operation Code, attended a Seattle code school, doubled my income, and improved my standard of living. <b>Thanks to Operation Code I'm doing what I love</b>."</p>

          <p>"I enlisted in the Marine Corps Infantry to serve and win our country's wars. After my service, I searched for a new career. I knew I wanted to be part of the tip of the spear in an industry and I realized the tech industry is leading from the front. <b>I Googled around and found Operation Code, a non-profit which helps veterans like me break into the tech industry. A couple weeks later they found a way to get me into GitHub's <a href="http://codeconf.com/">CodeConf LA</a></b>. There, I found <b><a href="http://sabio.la/">Sabio</a></b>, a local code school which accepts the New GI Bill. Today, I am in the middle of a <b><a href="http://vetshack.us/">hackathon</a></b> sponsored by Sabio in an effort to build a website to help folks in the military be successful by the time they get out. Operation Code not only paved a route for me, they also showed me what I can build with my imagination. <b>Imagine what it can do for other veterans</b>."</p>
