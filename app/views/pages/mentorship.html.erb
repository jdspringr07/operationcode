        <h5>Program Overview</h5>
        <p>Operation Code's Software Mentorship Program connects transitioning military, citizen-soldiers, veterans and their families with professional software developers for life-long learning and understanding. Paired online in our peer-to-peer learning environment, you can select any programming language/stack of your choice.</p>

        <p>The Program is designed to support your pursuit of becoming a software developer. Additionally, we have a thriving <a href="https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/free-code-camp/">#free-code-camp</a> study group, and location-based communities, from <a href="https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/seattle/">#Seattle</a> to <a href="https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/washingtondc/">#washingtondc</a> to meet others locally in your area and organize <a href="http://meetup.com/operationcode/">Operation Code meetups</a>.</p>

        <p class="lead">Below is an example of our <a href="https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/javascript/" target="_blank">#javascript</a> channel in action where a member of our community inquired about a component of her code in her web application that wasn't working properly and the response from one of our volunteer JavaScript experts:</p>

          <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A veteran asked why her <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript?src=hash" target="_blank">#javascript</a> wasn&#39;t working right.
