My name is Conrad Hollomon, born and raised in Virginia Beach VA. I'm a US Army officer, currently on reserve status, one tour in Afghanistan from 2010-2011. In the military, I led IT and tactical communications teams, and worked hard to develop my fellow Soldiers and help them reach their full potential.

I'm currently working for a venture-backed energy tech startup called SparkMeter, developing a smart metering system that's being widely adopted by utilities serving customers in rural parts of Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. It's a great product that will help expand access to electricity for developing countries and emerging markets.

I've been fascinated by technology since I was a kid, and throughout the years, that's never changed. I got started in the tech industry working in QA at a video game developer called Harmonix Music Systems, where I learned what it was like to develop innovative products, and how engineers and designers came together to deliver awesome experiences for people. Ever since, I've been dedicated to helping people build great products, working hard to be a positive driving force for any team, by bringing an creative, collaborative, and decisive mindset to the table. The experience has taught me that innovation originates from inspiring leadership, and that inspiring leadership originates from service to others. This takes integrity, authenticity, and just a little bit of audacity, too. Why CodeConfLA?

>*Github is a cornerstone of the open source community, and having the opportunity to be a direct part of that community via this scholarship is a great honor. The way we build and design software has such a tremendous impact on the end product that users see, and use, and love - finding ways to learn from each other, finding ways to build cool things better and faster, is a true joy.*

*Conrad Hollomon is a test engineer for SparkMeter, an Army Officer and an operations volunteer for Operation Code. He resides in Boston, Massachusetts and is [@hollomancer](https://twitter.com/hollomancer) on Twitter.*
