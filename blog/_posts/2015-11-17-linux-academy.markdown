When I began my career as a software developer I remember being mystified by the systems which made the applications I wrote available over the internet.  As I took my first tentative steps into the world of system administration, I found that resources for learning these skills were few and tended to assume knowledge I did not have.

[Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com) has taken bold steps into providing accessible and excellent quality system administration instruction.  Along with the basics of Linux, Linux Academy also provides extensive depth on the latest technologies like Amazon Web Services and Docker.  They are an extremely valuable resource to both new developers and seasoned system administrators looking to level up their skills.

Linux Academy was also gracious enough to provide us with a number of free 6 month subscriptions, which are already being used by our veterans to learn new skills and build upon the skills they have learned at coding bootcamps.  We thank Linux Academy for helping our veterans learn the Linux skills of today and lay the foundation for the Linux and system administration skills of tomorrow!
