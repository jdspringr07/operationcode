Google is known for search. When we get stuck coding we Google every command line or inspect element error which leads to a blog, StackOverFlow, YouTube video, an article or a podcast that helps us get closer to the solution.

Google is *also* known for helping nonprofits get more done through the [Google for Nonprofits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/) program.

Prior to being enrolled in the program, we paid monthly to have a few email accounts for the team and this limited us in terms of growth and volunteer staff. That all just changed.

These past two weeks Operation Code has grown leaps and bounds organizationally, as we started issuing Operation Code email accounts to the software mentorship, scholarship, employer services, deploy and advocacy teams. Google for Nonprofits is enabling Operation Code to better coordinate, integrate and synchronize our services to better serve our military veterans coding community.

From their web page:

>“Google for Nonprofits offers organizations like yours free access to Google tools like Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Ad Grants, YouTube for Nonprofits and more. These tools can help you reach new donors and volunteers, work more efficiently, and tell your nonprofit’s story.”

Thank you so much, Google, for helping us in changing the world for those who've served our country.
