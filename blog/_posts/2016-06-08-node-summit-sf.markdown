Along with teaching coding skills, Operation Code is also dedicated to setting up networks for our military veterans.  One of the best ways to grow a network is to attend a technical conference.

We are delighted that [Node Summit](http://nodesummit.com/) - which will be held on July 26-28 in San Francisco, CA - has granted us four scholarship tickets for use by our veterans.

From their web page:

>“Node.js has taken its rightful place within critical enterprise environments and is well into “prime time”. Node Summit 2016 will bring together technology and business leaders and technology experts to discuss Node.js’ transformative role in the future of computing.”

Thank you so much, Node Summit, for providing the means for our veterans to learn and grow.  We will see you there!
