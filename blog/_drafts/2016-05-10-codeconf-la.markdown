At Operation Code, we go beyond just saying, "support our veterans, troops, and their families," we execute on it by providing the operating environment to become software developers. One company that is always shipping and enables Operation Code to fulfill our mission of getting more military veterans and their families coding is GitHub.

As you might remember last month, GitHub provided the Operation Code community scholarship tickets for [GitMerge](http://git-merge.com/) in New York and again have graciously extended the offer in supporting our military veterans transition to software development with next month's CodeConf in sunny Los Angeles. From their [blog](https://github.com/blog/2121-codeconf-la-tickets-are-now-on-sale):

"CodeConf LA will converge June 27-29, 2016 in sunny Los Angeles for three days of unforgettable discussions. This year’s event will focus on systems engineering projects, practices, and programs in the open source community. We'll explore topics ranging from systems programming practices to operating applications at scale over three days and 30+ sessions, lightning talks, and workshops."

As our Scholarship Chair, [@nellshamrell](https://twitter.com/nellshamrell) put it, "One of the best ways to learn, network, and find job opportunities in the IT industry is through attending conferences."

As Marine veteran [@jjamespdx](https://twitter.com/jjamespdx) put it, "For some veterans learning to code, the idea of going to a technical conference is a daunting task. You don’t know the jargon that well, you don’t know all the big names or faces, and you often times don’t know anyone else at the event. It’s a veritable mix of excitement to start getting into the community and the fear that you won’t or don’t belong. That’s exactly how I felt when the opportunity came up to go to [Ruby on Ales](https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/04/26/ruby-on-ales-2016.html) via an Operation Code scholarship. Luckily for me, the experience was far greater than I could have expected."

So there you go. Short suspense. Apply ASAP.

Current status: 2 tickets remaining.  

Cheers and keep coding,
