One of the best ways to learn, network, and find job opportunities in the IT industry is through attending conferences.  My very first tech conference was Cascadia Ruby 2011 where I was amazed at the variety of talks (many covering technologies and techniques I was immediately able to apply in my work), the interesting conversations in the "hallway track", and the joy of talking with others working with the same technologies I was learning.

Five conferences have kindly offered scholarship opportunities for members of Operation Code.  These scholarships will provide a free ticket to attend the conference.  Unfortunately, we are not able to cover travel expenses at this time, but we will encourage scholarship recipients to team up in carpooling, housing, etc.
