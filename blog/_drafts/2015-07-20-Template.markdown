Here's a quick template you can duplicate with instructions for making your blog post.

#Create Post File
Each Jekyll blog post lives as a separate markdown file. Make a new markdown file in the `/blog/_drafts` directory. Note the file format for each post file is `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post`

#Write Post
## Front Matter
"Front Matter" YAML descriptors must be added to the very top of each post file. See the example above in between the mandatory top & bottom `---` lines.

## Post Body & Content
You can now write your blog post in normal markdown in this file.

#How to Rebuild Jekyll Site and Publish Post
Once the post is ready to publish you can move it to `/blog/_posts`. Then you must rebuild the Jekyll site to update and show the new post.
